# Recyclomator

The application is focused on promoting recycling through easy collaboration between users. 
Users can "donate" their plastic and glass bottles for others to pick up, who can then take them 
to a recycling center and potentially collect the deposit. The user with the bottles would be able 
to specify what items they have for recycling and the times when they can hand them 
over (or leave them at the door). Those interested in recycling will have access to a map (or list) 
showing available items and recycling locations. After selecting an offer, they will see details, 
including a list of items to recycle and the available times for pick-up. The user would choose 
a time that suits them, make a reservation, and the original poster would receive a notification. 
The app would also offer a history of users' activities.
